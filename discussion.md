Heres my teake on this assisnment, it was challenging not because it was hard but because i havent coded in react native in so long. I really do enjoy react mainly because its so much stuff you can do. one of the problems i think were picking at my brain was the trying to figure out how to get divs working in react native as well as how slow my computer are when it comes with working with mobile development. The expo client app kept shutting off in the middle of me trying to check my work as well as some of the lines of code would just not save when clicking save. Other than that I have to say this was a really great assignment to get people's blood flowing and ready to use logic on the whats, hows is this possible to work and so fourth. My time was spent really well, I actiaully been up since yesterday and its now going on 645am. Like I said I really do enjoy learning and coding, its a obsession and i am willing to become one of the top enigneer in the company. This hunger I have is forever, The world is a jungle you either fight and dominate or hide and evaporate.
